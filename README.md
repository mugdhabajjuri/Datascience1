This project is a part of course EECS 731. In this project we will try to combine two data sets to establish additional value.

Datasets considered here are "Olympics data" and "World population"

Path to Olympic data --> /data/external/athlete_events.csv

Path to Population data --> /data/external/population2.csv

Raw data 

athelet_events.csv is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results#athlete_events.csv) - Kaggle

population2.csv is taken from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)) - Wikipedia
